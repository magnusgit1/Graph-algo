# Graph-algo

Pure Java program using various data structures and algorithms to collect information and find paths among actors in the IMBD-database (using .tsv files).

Once ran, it will display 2 separate paths. One of which displays the path that includes the highest-rated movies among the two actors (Djikstra), and one which displays the shortest path, ignoring ratings (BFS/DFS).

## How to use

Clone the repo using: git clone http://magnusgit1/Graph-algo.git

You can change the actors of which you want a find a path between by simply changing the names in the "skrivutBilligsteVei" and "skrivutRaskesteVei"-method-calls in main.
